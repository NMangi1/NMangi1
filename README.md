Hello! I'm Nik, and this is where I plan to put my "portfolio": 
a somewhat random collection of projects/tasks that I'm working on to sharpen my skills.

| Project Link  | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 | Row 1, Col 4 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 | Row 2, Col 4 |
| Row 3, Col 1 | Row 3, Col 2 | Row 3, Col 3 | Row 3, Col 4 |
